This is what we call water bucket challenage 

preface:
1: there is a source of water that flows a unit of water continously downwards

2: there is grid throught which either contais water that continously or block that water to flow downward but splits in their  side blocks

3: there are a series of buckets in the end of grid that will catch the water that was falling and shows us how much water is in it  

4: if there is single water flow enoicnter a  block then it will split into 2 one unit of water
